 Correlation functions of the integrable higher-spin XXX and XXZ spin chains through the fusion methodTetsuo Deguchia, , , Chihiro Matsuib, c, a Department of Physics, Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Ochanomizu University, 2-1-1 Ohtsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8610, Japanb Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japanc CREST, JST, 4-1-8 Honcho Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, JapanReceived 23 July 2009, Accepted 21 December 2009, Available online 4 January 2010AbstractFor the integrable higher-spin XXX and XXZ spin chains we present multiple-integral representations for the correlation function of an arbitrary product of Hermitian elementary matrices in the massless ground state. We give a formula expressing it by a single term of multiple integrals. In particular, we explicitly derive the emptiness formation probability (EFP). We assume 2s-strings for the ground-state solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations for the spin-s XXZ chain, and solve the integral equations for the spin-s Gaudin matrix. In terms of the XXZ coupling Δ we define ζ   by Δ=cosζ, and put it in a region 0⩽ζ<π/2s0⩽ζ<π/2s of the gapless regime: −1<Δ⩽1−1<Δ⩽1 (0⩽ζ<π0⩽ζ<π), where Δ=1Δ=1 (ζ=0ζ=0) corresponds to the antiferromagnetic point. We calculate the zero-temperature correlation functions by the algebraic Bethe-ansatz, introducing the Hermitian elementary matrices in the massless regime, and taking advantage of the fusion construction of the R-matrix of the higher-spin representations of the affine quantum group.1. IntroductionThe correlation functions of the spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain have been studied extensively through the algebraic Bethe-ansatz during the last decade [1]; [2]; [3]; [4]; [5] ;  [6]. The multiple-integral representations of the correlation functions for the infinite lattice at zero temperature first derived through the affine quantum-group symmetry [7] ;  [8] and also by solving the q-KZ equations [9] ;  [10] have been rederived and then generalized into those for the finite-size lattice under nonzero magnetic field. They are also extended into those at finite temperatures [11]. Furthermore, the asymptotic expansion of a correlation function has been systematically discussed [12]. Thus, the exact study of the correlation functions of the XXZ spin chain should be not only very fruitful but also quite fundamental in the mathematical physics of integrable models.
