 Review PaperMethods for in vitro evaluating antimicrobial activity: A review ☆Mounyr Balouiri, , Moulay Sadiki, Saad Koraichi Ibnsouda Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, B.P. 2202 Imouzzer Road, Fez, MoroccoReceived 22 August 2015, Revised 21 November 2015, Accepted 23 November 2015, Available online 2 December 2015AbstractIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in researching and developing new antimicrobial agents from various sources to combat microbial resistance. Therefore, a greater attention has been paid to antimicrobial activity screening and evaluating methods. Several bioassays such as disk-diffusion, well diffusion and broth or agar dilution are well known and commonly used, but others such as flow cytofluorometric and bioluminescent methods are not widely used because they require specified equipment and further evaluation for reproducibility and standardization, even if they can provide rapid results of the antimicrobial agent's effects and a better understanding of their impact on the viability and cell damage inflicted to the tested microorganism. In this review article, an exhaustive list of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and detailed information on their advantages and limitations are reported.KeywordsThin-layer chromatography (TLC)–bioautography; Time-kill test; Antimicrobial gradient method; Agar diffusion method1. IntroductionAntimicrobial susceptibility testing can be used for drug discovery, epidemiology and prediction of therapeutic outcome. In this review, we focused on the use of antimicrobial testing methods for the in vitro investigation of extracts and pure drugs as potential antimicrobial agents.After the revolution in the “golden era”, when almost all groups of important antibiotics (tetracyclines, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and macrolides) were discovered and the main problems of chemotherapy were solved in the 1960s, the history repeats itself nowadays and these exciting compounds are in danger of losing their efficacy because of the increase in microbial resistance [1]. Currently, its impact is considerable with treatment failures associated with multidrug-resistant bacteria and it has become a global concern to public health [2] ;  [3].For this reason, discovery of new antibiotics is an exclusively important objective. Natural products are still one of the major sources of new drug molecules today. They are derived from prokaryotic bacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms, plants and various animal organisms. Microbial and plant products occupy the major part of the antimicrobial compounds discovered until now [4].Plants and other natural sources can provide a huge range of complex and structurally diverse compounds. Recently, many researchers have focused on the investigation of plant and microbial extracts, essential oils, pure secondary metabolites and new synthetized molecules as potential antimicrobial agents [5]; [6] ;  [7]. However, when we reviewed the published articles on the antimicrobial effect of these natural products, the comparison between results is often difficult, because of the use of different non-standardized approaches inoculum preparation techniques, inoculum size, growth medium, incubation conditions and endpoints determination.The fact that a plant extract exhibits antimicrobial activity is of interest, but this preliminary part of data should be trustworthy and allow researchers to compare results, avoiding work in which researchers use the antimicrobial activity investigation only as a complement to a phytochemical study.A variety of laboratory methods can be used to evaluate or screen the in vitro antimicrobial activity of an extract or a pure compound. The most known and basic methods are the disk-diffusion and broth or agar dilution methods. Other methods are used especially for antifungal testing, such as poisoned food technique. To further study the antimicrobial effect of an agent in depth, time-kill test and flow cytofluorometric methods are recommended, which provide information on the nature of the inhibitory effect (bactericidal or bacteriostatic) (time-dependent or concentration-dependent) and the cell damage inflicted to the test microorganism.Owing to the new attraction to the properties of new antimicrobial products like combating multidrug-resistant bacteria, it is important to develop a better understanding of the current methods available for screening and/or quantifying the antimicrobial effect of an extract or a pure compound for its applications in human health, agriculture and environment. Therefore, in this review, the techniques for evaluating the in vitro antimicrobial activity were discussed in detail.2. Diffusion methods2.1. Agar disk-diffusion methodAgar disk-diffusion testing developed in 1940 [8], is the official method used in many clinical microbiology laboratories for routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Nowadays, many accepted and approved standards are published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for bacteria and yeasts testing [9] ;  [10]. Although not all fastidious bacteria can be tested accurately by this method, the standardization has been made to test certain fastidious bacterial pathogens like streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, using specific culture media, various incubation conditions and interpretive criteria for inhibition zones [9].In this well-known procedure, agar plates are inoculated with a standardized inoculum of the test microorganism. Then, filter paper discs (about 6 mm in diameter), containing the test compound at a desired concentration, are placed on the agar surface. The Petri dishes are incubated under suitable conditions. Generally, antimicrobial agent diffuses into the agar and inhibits germination and growth of the test microorganism and then the diameters of inhibition growth zones are measured (Fig. 1A). Table 1 shows the growth media, temperature, period of incubation and inoculum size required by CLSI standards.Fig. 1. Agar diffusion methods: (A) disk-diffusion method of microbial extract using C. albicans as test microorganism, (B) agar well diffusion method of essential oil using Aspergillus niger as test microorganism, and (C) agar plug diffusion method of Bacillus sp. against C. albicans.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide
