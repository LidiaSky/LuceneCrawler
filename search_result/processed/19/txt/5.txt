 Not entitled to full textSelective adsorption of CH3SH on cobalt-modified activated carbon with low oxygen concentrationOriginal Research ArticlePages 156-163Langlang Wang, Xueqian Wang, Ping Ning, Wei Liu, Fei Wang, Yixing MaAbstractClose graphical abstractResearch highlights Purchase PDF - $35.95
Compared with CH3SH, the CH3SH breakthrough capacity of Co/AC in the presence of H2S or COS was reduced. Blank AC adsorption efficiency was clearly higher than Co/AC for H2S and COS, and H2S and COS were barely adsorbed by Co/AC. Therefore, Co/AC had a better selectivity for the removal of methyl mercaptan in the presence of H2S and COS, which was closely related to the different melt boiling point, physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. Not entitled to full textExperimental and CFD modeling of diazinon pesticide removal using fixed bed column with Cu-modified zeolite nanoparticleOriginal Research ArticlePages 164-173Hossein Esfandian, Abdolraouf Samadi-Maybodi, Behnam Khoshandam, Mehdi ParviniAbstractClose graphical abstractResearch highlights Purchase PDF - $35.95

Supplementary contentIn this study, we prepared quaternary silver-zinc-tin-selenide samples on various substrates using the selenization of thermally evaporated silver-zinc-tin metal precursors. The sample with the [Zn]/[Sn] molar ratio of 1.42 has the maximum photo-enhancement current density of 5.69 and 11.12 mAcm−2 at an applied bias of +1.0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode in the 0.5 M K2SO4 and 1 M NaCl aqueous solution, respectively. Not entitled to full textInfluence of [Cu]/[Cu+Sn] molar ratios in p-type Cu–Sn–S photoelectrodes on their photoelectrochemical performances in water and salt–water solutionsOriginal Research ArticlePages 209-219Kong-Wei ChengAbstractClose graphical abstractResearch highlights Purchase PDF - $35.95
Ternary copper–tin–sulfide thin films are prepared on various substrates by using the sulfurization of co-sputtering Cu–Sn metal precursors. The effect of the [Cu]/[Cu+Sn] molar ratio in samples on the structural and photoelectrochemical performances of Cu–Sn–S samples in various electrolytes is examined. The maximum photoelectrochemical performances of the samples in 0.5 M K2SO4 and 1 M NaCl aqueous solutions are 0.55 and 0.34 mA/cm2 at an external potential of −1.2 V versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode under light illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW/cm2, respectively. Not entitled to full textMaterials Science and TechnologyAn experimental study on optimum concentration of silver-water microfluid for enhancing heat transfer performance of a plate heat exchangerOriginal Research ArticlePages 220-227S.H.
