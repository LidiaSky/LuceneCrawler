 Feature ArticlePolymer nanotechnology: NanocompositesD.R. Paula, 1, Author Vitae, L.M. Robesonb, , Author Vitaea Department of Chemical Engineering and Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United Statesb Lehigh University, 1801 Mill Creek Road, Macungie, PA 18062, United StatesReceived 19 February 2008, Revised 2 April 2008, Accepted 4 April 2008, Available online 13 April 2008AbstractIn the large field of nanotechnology, polymer matrix based nanocomposites have become a prominent area of current research and development. Exfoliated clay-based nanocomposites have dominated the polymer literature but there are a large number of other significant areas of current and emerging interest. This review will detail the technology involved with exfoliated clay-based nanocomposites and also include other important areas including barrier properties, flammability resistance, biomedical applications, electrical/electronic/optoelectronic applications and fuel cell interests. The important question of the “nano-effect” of nanoparticle or fiber inclusion relative to their larger scale counterparts is addressed relative to crystallization and glass transition behavior. Of course, other polymer (and composite)-based properties derive benefits from nanoscale filler or fiber addition and these are addressed.KeywordsNanotechnology; Nanocomposites; Exfoliated clay1. IntroductionThe field of nanotechnology is one of the most popular areas for current research and development in basically all technical disciplines. This obviously includes polymer science and technology and even in this field the investigations cover a broad range of topics. This would include microelectronics (which could now be referred to as nanoelectronics) as the critical dimension scale for modern devices is now below 100 nm. Other areas include polymer-based biomaterials, nanoparticle drug delivery, miniemulsion particles, fuel cell electrode polymer bound catalysts, layer-by-layer self-assembled polymer films, electrospun nanofibers, imprint lithography, polymer blends and nanocomposites. Even in the field of nanocomposites, many diverse topics exist including composite reinforcement, barrier properties, flame resistance, electro-optical properties, cosmetic applications, bactericidal properties. Nanotechnology is not new to polymer science as prior studies before the age of nanotechnology involved nanoscale dimensions but were not specifically referred to as nanotechnology until recently. Phase separated polymer blends often achieve nanoscale phase dimensions; block copolymer domain morphology is usually at the nanoscale level; asymmetric membranes often have nanoscale void structure, miniemulsion particles are below 100 nm; and interfacial phenomena in blends and composites involve nanoscale dimensions. Even with nanocomposites, carbon black reinforcement of elastomers, colloidal silica modification and even naturally occurring fiber (e.g., asbestos-nanoscale fiber diameter) reinforcement are subjects that have been investigated for decades. Almost lost in the present nanocomposite discussions are the organic–inorganic nanocomposites based on sol–gel chemistry which have been investigated for several decades [1]; [2] ;  [3]. In essence, the nanoscale of dimensions is the transition zone between the macro-level and the molecular level. Recent interest in polymer matrix based nanocomposites has emerged initially with interesting observations involving exfoliated clay and more recent studies with carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, exfoliated graphite (graphene), nanocrystalline metals and a host of additional nanoscale inorganic filler or fiber modifications.This review will discuss polymer matrix based nanocomposites with exfoliated clay being one of the key modifications. While the reinforcement aspects of nanocomposites are the primary area of interest, a number of other properties and potential applications are important including barrier properties, flammability resistance, electrical/electronic properties, membrane properties, polymer blend compatibilization. An important consideration in this review involves the comparison of properties of nanoscale dimensions relative to larger scale dimensions. The synergistic advantage of nanoscale dimensions (“nano-effect”) relative to larger scale modification is an important consideration. Understanding the property changes as the particle (or fiber) dimensions decrease to the nanoscale level is important to optimize the resultant nanocomposite. As will be noted, many nanocomposite systems noted in the literature can still be modeled using continuum models where absolute size is not important since only shape and volume fraction loading are necessary to predict properties. Nanoscale is considered where the dimensions of the particle, platelet or fiber modification are in the range of 1–100 nm. With the platelet or fiber, the smallest dimension is considered for that range (platelet thickness or fiber diameter).2. Fundamental considerationsIn the area of nanotechnology, polymer matrix based nanocomposites have generated a significant amount of attention in the recent literature. This area emerged with the recognition that exfoliated clays could yield significant mechanical property advantages as a modification of polymeric systems [4]; [5] ;  [6]. The achieved results were at least initially viewed as unexpected (“nano-effect”) offering improved properties over that expected from continuum mechanics predictions. More recent results have, however, indicated that while the property profile is interesting, the clay-based nanocomposites often obey continuum mechanics predictions. There are situations where nanocomposites can exhibit properties not expected with larger scale particulate reinforcements.It is now well-recognized that the crystallization rate and degree of crystallinity can be influenced by crystallization in confined spaces. In these cases, the dimensions available for spherulitic growth are confined such that primary nuclei are not present for heterogeneous crystallization and homogeneous nucleation thus results. This results in the value of n in the Avrami equation approaching one and often leads to reduced crystallization rate, degree of crystallinity and melting point. This has been observed in phase separated block copolymers [7] ;  [8] and has also been observed in polymer blends [9]. Confined crystallization of linear polyethylene in nanoporous alumina showed homogeneous nucleation with pore diameters of 62–110 nm but heterogeneous nucleation for 15–48 nm pores [10]. Linear polyethylene [11] and syndiotactic polystyrene [12] in nanoporous alumina both showed decreased crystallinity versus bulk crystallization. With nanoparticle incorporation in a polymer matrix, similarities to confined crystallinity (as noted above for crystallization in nanopores) exist as well as nucleation effects and disruption of attainable spherulite size.With inorganic particle and nanoparticle inclusions, nucleation of crystallization can occur. At the nanodimension scale, the nanoparticle can substitute for the absence of primary nuclei thus competing with the confined crystallization. At higher nanoparticle content, the increased viscosity (decreased chain diffusion rate) can lead to decreased crystallization kinetics. Thus, the crystallization process is complex and influenced by several competing factors. Nucleation of crystallization (at low levels of addition) evidenced by the onset temperature of crystallization (Tc) and crystallization half-time has been observed in various nanocomposites (poly(ɛ-caprolactone)–nanoclay [13], polyamide 66–nanoclay [14] ;  [15], polylactide–nanoclay [16], polyamide 6–nanoclay [17], polyamide 66–multi-walled carbon nanotube [18], polyester–nanoclay [19], poly(butylene terephthalate)–nanoclay [20], polypropylene–nanoclay (sepiolite) [21], polypropylene/multi-walled carbon nanotube [22]). At higher levels of nanoparticle addition, retardation of the crystallization rate has been observed even in those systems where nucleation was observed at low levels of nanoparticle incorporation [15]; [18]; [20]; [22]; [23] ;  [24]. The higher level of nanoparticle inclusion was noted to yield retardation of crystallization due to diffusion constraints. This was also apparent in a study where unmodified and organically modified clay were incorporated in maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene [25]. Nucleation was observed with unmodified clay, whereas the exfoliated clay yielded a reduced crystallization rate. A recent review of the crystallization behavior of layered silicate clay nanocomposites noted that while nucleation is observed in many systems the overall crystallization rate is generally reduced particularly at higher levels of nanoclay addition [26].
