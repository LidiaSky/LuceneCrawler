In this study, 555 Facebook users completed measures of the Big Five, self-esteem, narcissism, motives for using Facebook, and frequency of updating about a range of topics. Results revealed that extraverts more frequently updated about their social activities and everyday life, which was motivated by their use of Facebook to communicate and connect with others. People high in openness were more likely to update about intellectual topics, consistent with their use of Facebook for sharing information. Participants who were low in self-esteem were more likely to update about romantic partners, whereas those who were high in conscientiousness were more likely to update about their children. Narcissists&rsquo; use of Facebook for attention-seeking and validation explained their greater likelihood of updating about their accomplishments and their diet and exercise routine. Furthermore, narcissists&rsquo; tendency to update about their accomplishments explained the greater number of likes and comments that they reported receiving to their updates.</P><!--VALIDHTML-->KeywordsFacebook; Social networking; Social media; Status updates; Big five; Self-esteem; Narcissism<!--VALIDHTML--><!--VALIDHTML-->1. Introduction<P>Why do some people write Facebook status updates that describe amusing personal anecdotes, whereas others write updates that declare love to a significant other, express political opinions, or recount the details of last night&rsquo;s dinner? Since the inception of Facebook in 2004, status updates have been one of its most preferred features (<A href="#b0115">Ryan &amp; Xenos, 2011</A>). Status updates allow users to share their thoughts, feelings, and activities with friends, who have the opportunity to &ldquo;like&rdquo; and comment in return. In spite of the central role of status updates in Facebook use, few studies have examined the predictors of the topics that people choose to write about in their updates. The current study took a step in this direction by examining the personality traits associated with the frequency of updating about five broad topics identified through a factor analytic approach: social activities and everyday life, intellectual pursuits, accomplishments, diet/exercise, and significant relationships. We also examined whether these associations were mediated by some of the motives for using Facebook identified in the literature (e.g., <A href="#b0010">Bazarova and Choi, 2014</A>&nbsp;; &nbsp;<A href="#b0120">Seidman, 2013</A>): need for validation (i.e., seeking attention and acceptance), self-expression (i.e., disclosing personal opinions, stories, and complaints), communication (i.e., corresponding and connecting), and sharing impersonal information (e.g., current events).</P><!--VALIDHTML--><P>A secondary purpose of this study was to examine whether people who update more frequently about certain topics receive greater numbers of &ldquo;likes&rdquo; and comments to their updates. Those who do may experience the benefits of social inclusion, whereas those who do not might experience a lower sense of belonging, self-esteem, and meaningful existence (<A href="#b0135">Tobin, Vanman, Verreynne, &amp; Saeri, 2015</A>). Our results may therefore shed light on the status update topics that put Facebook users at risk of online ostracism. Below we review literature on personality traits and motives that are often linked with Facebook use.</P><!--VALIDHTML-->1.1. The Big Five<P>According to the &ldquo;Big Five&rdquo; model of personality, individuals vary in terms of extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (<A href="#b0040">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</A>). People who are extraverted are gregarious, talkative, and cheerful. They tend to use Facebook as a tool to communicate and socialize (<A href="#b0120">Seidman, 2013</A>), as reflected in their more frequent use of Facebook (<A href="#b0070">Gosling, Augustine, Vazire, Holtzmann, &amp; Gaddis, 2011</A>), greater number of Facebook friends (<A href="#b0005">Amichai-Hamburger &amp; Vinitzky, 2010</A>), and preference for features of Facebook that allow for active social contribution, such as status updates (<A href="#b0115">Ryan &amp; Xenos, 2011</A>). We therefore predicted that extraversion would be positively associated with updating about social activities, and that this association would be mediated by extraverts&rsquo; use of Facebook for communication (Hypothesis 1).</P><!--VALIDHTML--><P>Neuroticism is characterized by anxiety and sensitivity to threat. Neurotic individuals may use Facebook to seek the attention and social support that may be missing from their lives offline (<A href="#b0110">Ross et al., 2009</A>). Accordingly, neuroticism is positively associated with frequency of social media use (<A href="#b0035">Correa, Hinsley, &amp; de Zuniga, 2010</A>), the use of Facebook for social purposes (<A href="#b0080">Hughes, Rowe, Batey, &amp; Lee, 2012</A>), and engaging in emotional disclosure on Facebook, such as venting about personal dramas (<A href="#b0120">Seidman, 2013</A>). Their willingness to disclose about personal topics led us to predict that neuroticism would be positively associated with updating about close relationships (romantic partners and/or children), and that the selection of these topics would be motivated by their use of Facebook for validation and self-expression (Hypothesis 2).</P><!--VALIDHTML--><P>People who are high in openness tend to be creative, intellectual, and curious. Openness is positively associated with frequency of social media use (<A href="#b0035">Correa et al., 2010</A>), and with using Facebook for finding and disseminating information, but not for socializing (<A href="#b0080">Hughes et al., 2012</A>). We therefore predicted that openness would be positively associated with updating about intellectual topics, and that this association would be mediated by the use of Facebook for sharing information (Hypothesis 3).</P><!--VALIDHTML--><P>People who are high in agreeableness tend to be cooperative, helpful, and interpersonally successful. Agreeableness is positively associated with posting on Facebook to communicate and connect with others and negatively associated with posting to seek attention (<A href="#b0120">Seidman, 2013</A>) or to badmouth others (<A href="#b0125">Stoughton, Thompson, &amp; Meade, 2013</A>). The interpersonal focus of agreeable people and their use of Facebook for communication may inspire more frequent updates about their social activities and significant relationships (Hypothesis 4).</P><!--VALIDHTML--><P>Conscientiousness describes people who are organized, responsible, and hard-working. They tend to use Facebook less frequently than people who are lower in conscientiousness (<A href="#b0070">Gosling et al., 2011</A>), but when they do use it, conscientious individuals are diligent and discreet: they have more Facebook friends (<A href="#b0005">Amichai-Hamburger &amp; Vinitzky, 2010</A>), they avoid badmouthing people (<A href="#b0125">Stoughton et al., 2013</A>), and they are less likely to post on Facebook to seek attention or acceptance (<A href="#b0120">Seidman, 2013</A>). Thus, we predicted that conscientiousness would be positively associated with updating about inoffensive, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; topics (i.e., social activities and everyday life), which would be mediated by the lower tendency of using Facebook for validation (Hypothesis 5).</P><!--VALIDHTML-->1.2. Self-esteem<P>People with low self-esteem are more likely to see the advantages of self-disclosing on Facebook rather than in person, but because their status updates tend to express more negative and less positive affect, they tend to be perceived as less likeable (<A href="#b0060">Forest &amp; Wood, 2012</A>). Furthermore, anxiously-attached individuals &ndash; who tend to have low self-esteem (<A href="#b0025">Campbell &amp; Marshall, 2011</A>) &ndash; post more often about their romantic relationship to boost their self-worth and to refute others&rsquo; impressions that their relationship is poor (<A href="#b0055">Emery, Muise, Dix, &amp; Le, 2014</A>). We therefore hypothesized that self-esteem would be negatively associated with updating about a romantic partner, and that this association would be mediated by the use of Facebook for validation (Hypothesis 6).</P><!--VALIDHTML-->1.3. Narcissism<P>Narcissistic individuals tend to be self-aggrandizing, vain, and exhibitionistic (<A href="#b0100">Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988</A>). They seek attention and admiration by boasting about their accomplishments (<A href="#b0020">Buss &amp; Chiodo, 1991</A>) and take particular care of their physical appearance (<A href="#b9010">Vazire, Naumann, Rentfrow, &amp; Gosling, 2008</A>). This suggests that their status updates will more frequently reference their achievements and their diet and exercise routine (Hypothesis 7). Moreover, the choice of these topics may be motivated by the use of status updates to gain validation for inflated self-views, consistent with the positive association of narcissism with the frequency of updating one&rsquo;s status ( <A href="#b0030">Carpenter, 2012</A>), posting more self-promoting content (<A href="#b0085">Mehdizadeh, 2010</A>), and seeking to attract admiring friends to one&rsquo;s Facebook profile (<A href="#b0045">Davenport, Bergman, Bergman, &amp; Fearrington, 2014</A>).</P><!--VALIDHTML-->
