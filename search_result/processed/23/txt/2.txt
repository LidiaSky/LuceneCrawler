 ReviewProbiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosisM.E. Falagasa, b, c, , , G.I. Betsia, d, S. Athanasiouea Alfa Institute of Biomedical Sciences (AIBS), Marousi, Greeceb Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USAc Department of Medicine, Henry Dunant Hospital, Athensd Department of Medicine, General Hospital of Sparta, Spartae 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University School of Medicine, Athens, GreeceAccepted 4 December 2006, Available online 26 December 2014ABSTRACTThis review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV). There seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of BV. Many studies have suggested that the presence of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against BV, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. In-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce H2O2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV. Clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6–12 days, or oral administration of L. acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of BV (defined as a 0–1 positive score according to Amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of BV, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. However, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of BV and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. Thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of BV are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.KeywordsBacterial vaginosis; Gardnerella vaginalis; lactobacilli; probiotics; review; treatment; vaginosisINTRODUCTIONBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection causing significant gynaecological and obstetric morbidity. Apart from causing irritating symptoms, mainly a malodorous vaginal discharge, BV has been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease [1], infections following gynaecological surgery [2], and pre-term birth [3]. It has also been suggested that the presence of BV increases the risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection [4 ;  5]. Treatment with metronidazole or clindamycin, administered orally or intra-vaginally, has been followed by frequent recurrences of BV [6]. Because of its high morbidity and frequent recurrence following treatment, alternative therapeutic agents need to be sought for the treatment of BV.Probiotics are defined as ‘live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host’ [7]. Lactobacilli are the commonest organisms used as probiotics. Since the vaginal microbiota of women with BV has been found to contain a reduced number of lactobacilli in comparison with healthy women, lactobacilli administered orally or intra-vaginally have been tested for their effectiveness in colonising the vagina and curing women with BV, or at least preventing its recurrence.CHANGES IN VAGINAL MICROBIOTA DURING BVThe normal vaginal microbiota is normally dominated by lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus crispatus [ 8; 9; 10 ;  11], Lactobacillus jensenii [ 8 ;  11], Lactobacillus iners [ 9; 11 ;  12] and Lactobacillus gasseri [ 8; 10 ;  11]. Compared with that of normal women, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV consists more commonly, and in higher numbers, of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Mobiluncus and Bacteroides spp., while lactobacilli are found less frequently and in lower numbers. Nugent et al. [ 13] suggested that BV should be diagnosed when vaginal smears examined following Gram's stain are given a score of ≥7, after adding the points (1–4+) allocated to each of the following morphotypes: lactobacilli (large Gram-positive rods), G. vaginalis (small Gram-variable rods), Bacteroides spp. (small Gram-negative rods) and Mobiluncus spp. (curved Gram-variable rods). The higher the number of the specific morphotypes per oil immersion field, the higher the number of points for each morphotype, except for lactobacilli, the absence of which obtained the highest score.There is strong evidence that the absence of vaginal lactobacilli is associated with the development of BV. Alvarez-Olmos et al. [ 14] found a negative association between BV and the presence of lactobacilli in the vaginas of females aged 14–18 years (p 0.034). Similarly, vaginal lactobacilli were isolated from 73.7% of 825 women without BV, and from 29.8% of 131 women with BV (p <0.001) [15], from 74.3% of 2729 women without BV, and from 38.4% of 445 women with BV (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.8), in a study of pregnant women aged >18 years [16], and from 96% of 28 women without BV, and from 52% of 67 women with BV (p <0.001) [17].In addition, apart from the association between an absence of vaginal lactobacilli and BV, a possible association between low concentrations of vaginal lactobacilli and development of BV has been revealed by some studies. Thus, Zariffard et al. [ 18] analysed the cervicovaginal lavage samples of 21 human immunodeficiency virus-positive women by real-time PCR, and found that the median number of lactobacilli was significantly lower and the median number of G. vaginalis organisms was significantly higher in five women with BV, compared with 16 women without BV (8.5 × 106 vs. 1.1 × 109, p 0.013, and 1.3 × 1010 vs. 5.4 × 107, p 0.004, respectively). Mikamo et al. [ 19] also found that the mean count of Lactobacillus spp. was significantly lower in 129 G. vaginalis-positive women than in 110 G. vaginalis-negative women (7.02 vs. 8.66 log10 CFU/g, p <0.0001).It has been suggested that H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may prevent infection of the vaginal epithelium by bacteria that cause BV. Eschenbach et al. [ 17] isolated facultative H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli from 27 (96%) of 28 women without BV, and from four (6%) of 67 women with BV (p <0.001). In a study of pregnant women by Hillier et al. [ 20], H2O2-producing lactobacilli were isolated from 5% of women with BV (based on the Nugent score) and from 61 % of those with a normal microbiota (p <0.001). A second study of pregnant women by Hillier et al. [ 21] showed that BV (based on Amsel's criteria) was significantly less common among women with H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli (10/127, 8%) than among women with non-H2O2-producing or no lactobacilli (29/86, 34%, and 37/62, 60%, respectively; p <0.001 for both comparisons). Similarly, Hawes et al. [ 22] found that BV developed in ten (25%) of 40 women with non-H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, compared with only three (3%) of 118 women with H2O2-producing lactobacilli (p 0.02). Furthermore, a study by Antonio et al. [ 8] found that women with vaginal L. crispatus or L. jensenii (>94% of which were found to produce H2O2) were significantly less likely to have BV than were women colonised by other lactobacilli (only 22% of which produced H2O2) or women with no vaginal lactobacilli.In contrast, some studies do not support the protective role of H2O2-producing lactobacilli against BV. In the study by Alvarez-Olmos et al. [ 14] among women with vaginal lactobacilli, H2O2-producing lactobacilli were isolated from 85% of 18 women with BV, and from 15% of 43 women without BV [14]. Moreover, Rosenstein et al. [ 23] isolated H2O2-producing lactobacilli from 11 (91.7%) of 12 pregnant women whose microbiota was indicative of BV following Gram's stain.
