Gold open accessWhat is it?It is when published research is free for everyone to read and use. Here is how it works:Published articles are:Peer reviewedImmediately and permanently free for everyone to read and downloadAble to be reused in a number of different ways as defined by the user licensePermanently preserved in our digital archivesHave CrossMark® which links copies of the article to the final version of record to maintain the publication recordWhat does it cost?All gold open access articles are free for everyone to read. We can provide gold open access services because the article publishing charge (APC) that authors, their institutions or funding bodies pay, covers all expenses needed to support the publication process. Our APCs range from $500-$5000 USD and specific prices can be found on the individual journal’s homepages.Where can you publish?Open access journals: Do not have any subscribers and publish all their articles gold open access. See a list of open access journals published by ElsevierHybrid journals: Support open access and are two journals in one: a subscription journal and an open access journal. After acceptance authors can choose how they wish to publish and broadcast their research.Subsidized journals: Published research is free to read and the APC is subsidized by an organization or society which means authors do not need to directly pay.Complying with policiesWe are also able to help researchers in complying with the policies of their funders and institutions. We have established a number of agreements with organizations such as the Wellcome Trust, Research Councils UK, which help outline the compliant open access options available to researchers. See our list of funding body agreements.LicensesEveryone is able to download, copy and share gold open access articles. We provide authors with a choice of publishing under either the Creative Commons licenses CC-BY or the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND user license. These licenses will help maximize the impact of your article, getting the most spread and use out of it. Click here for the details.
 Read more about green open access
Green open accessWhat is it?It is a version of a subscription article which is also free for everyone to access.What does it cost?Green open access is possible because subscribers pay all the expenses needed to support the publication process. This means authors do not need to pay any additional charges.When can you share?Millions of researchers have subscriptions to immediately access research on ScienceDirect. To enable open access for a subscription article a time delay, known as an embargo period, is needed. This begins from the date the article is formally published online in its final and fully citable form (i.e. online publication date or the issue publication date). Our embargo periods typically range from 12 – 24 months and specific embargo periods can be found on the individual journal homepages. Search for an embargo period How can you share?Linking: Sharing a link to the article can be done immediately either via our Share Link service or with the article’s permanent address (DOI)Open Archives: Everyone can read and download free archived material in 105 Elsevier journals after an embargo period. See a list of journals with open archives.Self-archiving: Authors can post a copy of their research for everyone to read for free. See our sharing policy for details.New servicesThere are also alternative ways Elsevier is enabling linking to articles. For example, if your funder partners with CHORUS, all readers will be able search for your article and follow a link to ScienceDirect where they can access either the final version of the article or the accepted manuscript.
